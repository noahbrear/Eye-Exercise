# Description of the Program

This program generates two eyes in the center of the screen. When a mouse is present and the page is active, the pupils follow the cursor. This program contains three files: index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css. 

# How to Run

To run this program, download all the files and store them in the same folder. Then drag and drop the index.html file onto an open browser window.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements

To enhance this program, a third eye will be placed in between but slightly above the two eyes. When the user clicks on any of the eyes, they will blink.
